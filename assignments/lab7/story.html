            I've heard a lot about the benefits of MacOS, but when I first switched from Windows to Mac, I thought it was a really bad system.<br>
            Just like IOS system, too many transition animations. I click on something and need it to show up in front of me as quickly as <br>
            possible. And the Mac system does not support the installation of some software. Many scientific research software I needed at that<br>
            time required me to use a virtual machine to install and use it, which really annoyed me.

            But because of the portability and long battery life of the MacBook, I insisted on using it. The other day I spent a night on youtube<br> 
            learning how to be more productive with MacOS and it totally opened up a whole new world for me. The MacOS terminal and some task<br>
            scheduling are so efficient and orderly. I've stuck with MacOS ever since.
